  <h2>Kyle Stewart</h2>
  <p>
  I’m a software developer currently making the transition to embedded software development. I’m passionate about creating unique experiences with the products we use every day as well as products that don't yet exist. Working with hardware has been a very consuming hobby of mine for the last 10 years. <a href="https://medium.com/@KyleRStewart/">Follow along</a> with me as I learn how to go from hobbyist to professional.
  </p>

  <h2>Experience</h2>
  <p>
  I’ve spent the last 5 years building creative experiences on mobile. I've also spent a good deal of time doing full stack development to support these experiences. Check out more details about my work experience on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/kyle-stewart-91851166">LinkedIn</a>.
